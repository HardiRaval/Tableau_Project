# Project 1: Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard provides a visual exploration of a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows available on (simulated) Netflix. It aims to offer insights into the platform's content library, including its composition by type, geographical origin, age ratings, popular genres, and the trend of content additions over time.

## Overview of the Dashboard

The dashboard is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset at a glance. It includes the following key sections:

* **Top Left: Single Movie/Show Details:** Displays specific information for a selected title, such as its release year, rating, genre, date added, duration, and a brief description. (In the current view, it shows details for "1 Chance 2 Dance").
* **Top Right: Movies & TV Shows Distribution:** A pie chart illustrating the percentage and count of movies versus TV shows in the dataset. This provides a high-level understanding of the content mix.
* **Middle Left: Total Movies & TV Shows By Country:** A world map visualizing the number of movies and TV shows originating from different countries. Color intensity indicates the volume of content from each region.
* **Middle Right: Ratings:** A bar chart showing the distribution of content across various age-based ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13). This highlights the maturity level of the available content.
* **Bottom Left: Top 10 Genre:** A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 most frequent genre combinations within the dataset, allowing for quick identification of popular content categories.
* **Bottom Right: Total TV Shows & Movies By Year:** An area chart tracking the number of movies and TV shows added to the platform over the years, showcasing the growth of the content library.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard (Based on the Provided Image)

* **Movie Dominance:** Movies constitute a larger portion (68.42%) of the content compared to TV shows (31.58%).
* **US Content Leadership:** The United States appears to be the largest contributor of content to the platform.
* **Mature Audience Focus:** A significant portion of the content is rated for mature audiences (TV-MA).
* **Popular Genres:** Documentaries and Stand-Up Comedy are among the most frequent genre categories.
* **Content Growth Trend:** There has been a significant increase in the addition of both movies and TV shows, particularly in the years leading up to 2020.

## Potential Use Cases

This dashboard can be used for:

* Understanding the content landscape of the platform.
* Identifying areas for potential content acquisition.
* Analyzing the distribution of content across different regions and age groups.
* Tracking the evolution of the content library over time.

# Project 2: Mobile Device Usage Analysis - Tableau

This project involved the development of Tableau dashboards to analyze various aspects of mobile device usage. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from datasets related to user behavior, application usage patterns, and battery performance. By visualizing this data, the dashboards aim to identify key trends, understand user engagement, and align these findings with relevant business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Key Areas of Analysis

The dashboards focused on the following aspects:

* **User Behavior:** Analyzing how users interact with their devices, including the frequency and duration of usage.
* **App Usage:** Investigating the types of applications used, the time spent on each app, and identifying popular or frequently used applications.
* **Battery Performance:** Examining battery consumption patterns, identifying power-intensive applications, and understanding factors affecting battery life.

## Developed Dashboards

The Tableau dashboards were designed to:

* **Visualize User Engagement:** Showcase patterns in daily and weekly device usage, highlighting peak usage times and user activity levels.
* **Identify App Usage Trends:** Display the most frequently used applications, the distribution of usage time across different app categories, and user preferences for specific types of apps.
* **Analyze Battery Consumption:** Visualize battery drain over time, identify applications with high battery usage, and potentially correlate app usage with battery performance.

## Key Outcomes and Insights

By analyzing the datasets and visualizing the information in Tableau, the project aimed to:

* **Extract Actionable Insights:** Identify key trends and patterns in user behavior, app usage, and battery performance.
* **Showcase Patterns and Trends:** Clearly present the findings through intuitive visualizations, making it easy to understand user engagement levels and application preferences.
* **Align KPIs with Business Goals:** Provide data-driven insights that can inform business decisions related to user experience, application development, and device optimization.

## Potential Applications

The insights gained from these dashboards can be valuable for:

* Mobile device manufacturers in optimizing device performance and battery life.
* App developers in understanding user engagement with their applications.
* Businesses in analyzing employee mobile device usage patterns.
* Researchers studying user behavior and mobile technology adoption.
